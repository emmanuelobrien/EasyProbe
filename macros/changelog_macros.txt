V1.1)
1.) Message after pocket probe changed. Further information for resetting the midpoint to other coordinates are given.

2.) Message after pocket probe changed while in calibration. Because offsets and ranges are set to zero while calibration the shown diameter are wrongly calculated before.

3.) Further safety loops at beggining of all macros implemented. If ofsets and/or ranges are zero message that calibration has to be done and aborting.

V1.2)
1.) Error with fastforward (probe_ff) corrected. While probing small pockets the direction could be wrong. No possible harm for the machine, but an error occure.

2.) Safety checks at beginning of the macros now are separated to another macro (no changes to z minus macro).
